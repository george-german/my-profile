						Three years ago, I left my home country, Lebanon, to continue my higher education in France, facing uncertainty, upheaval, and broadened horizons for the first time in my life. However, never had I imagined I would learn much more than. Ever since, I have not stopped changing, learning and growing.

						Through my exchange programs, I learned to overcome my shyness and open up to the world. I learned to interact with people and learn from them, instead of believing in the absoluteness of my own ideas. Through volunteering, I became a more mature and engaged person. I learned to always get back on my feet and to never accept failure. I learned to use my own mistakes and my own faults and failures to become a better person. But most importantly, I have not stopped changing and learned to embrace change and to see change not as something to be feared but as an opportunity to grow and improve. With change, I am now able to move forward, to become a better person and to face increasingly difficult obstacles.
						The road before me is long, but I am not done changing. I now look forward to doing so, to learning from other people, and to constantly looking into myself.
